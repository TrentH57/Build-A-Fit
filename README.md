# Build-A-Fit
This current version was built ground up in 4 days during my time at a coding bootcamp. I am currently working on adding proper login and registration.
The idea came from my wife always asking me what she should wear. You can upload pictures of your wardrobe and plan outfits by simply swiping through your "headwear", "Tops", "Bottoms", and "footwear".
